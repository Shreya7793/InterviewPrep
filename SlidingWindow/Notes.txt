Q.How to identify questions?
Hint 1: Elements should be continuous/in sequence
Eg: list, string, subarray,
Hint 2: We are trying to achieve a state
Maximise, miminise, largest, smallest

Note this return technique:
return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;

Prefix sum technique:
Used for finding any subarray target sum
Use Hashmap<K,V> : <sum,index> -> here sum is prefix sum or cumiliative sum

Edge Cases:
Empty String, null value
Integer value =0 or > length of string
